# Math-Interpreter
A simple expression interpreter written in Kotlin. More of a test project to learn Kotlin.

# How to Use
It is pretty simple. Essentially, you just run it in the terminal and it will repeatedly ask for math expressions. You can type one in and press enter, and it will answer. It will ask for another. That is it.
